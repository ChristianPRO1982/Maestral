# Documentation Map — Maestral V2 (Android)

This folder is intentionally minimal for Codex context efficiency.

## Authoritative Documents

- `PRODUCT_SPEC_V2.md`
  - Functional source of truth (what to build).

- `TECH_STACK_V2.md`
  - Technical source of truth (how to build it).

## Rule

- If a technical or product decision changes, update one of these two files.
